## Base:

### Description
Making the base for the caster
### Evidence

### Reflection
Had a bit of trouble with aligning the hole pattern, eventually made some center lines to use as the direction for them, hopefully I did that right, it worked either way


## Mount:


### Description
Making the mount for the caster, pretty much the same as the base, but smaller.
### Evidence
[Mount](https://cvilleschools.onshape.com/documents/b7f59dcac0633dd6a51cf67c/w/f829e1386e8839178e00dad1/e/df5d5dc31249bb90b55d8450)

### Reflection
I got confused because I was spacing some things from the sides of the circle and not the center, I had a small mental breakdown and then recovered and realized I was spacing from the sides of the circles and that's why the measurements were wrong.
